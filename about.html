      <h1>About Retro Moonie</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>I started this site to be a personal archive of old Sailor Moon media that I've collected over the years, partically ones from the olden days (the late 90s/very early 00s). For those that were around back in that period, you would know that the internet was a much different place. Almost everybody had slow dial-up internet, computer harddrive space was very limited (often around the single digits in gigabytes for most people), and free web space was extremely limited, often around only in the 10s of megabytes. Because of this we didn't have rich streaming video, or high quality, high resolution videos and other media to watch or download. Videos were usually only encoded at 160x120 resolutions, sometimes higher, but this was the standard of this period. Frame rates often never higher than 15fps, and compression quality was mediocre at best due poorer compression algorithms at the time.</p>
      <p>However for some people, like me, this is also a nostalgic time, especially for a Sailor Moon fan. The internet used to be littered with low quality videos, images, audio, and other media of Sailor Moon like I described above, and we couldn't have been happier! Just having videos that we could play back and edit on our computers, share with others, etc., was good enough for us. It was also a time where we could finally get a taste of the undubbed parts of the show. I still remember the first video clip I ever downloaded, it was a clip of Eternal Sailor Moon giving her speech from Sailor Stars. It was a small 160x120 clip in all of its pixelated glory. It was the first time I had ever seen Sailor Moon outside the original English DiC dub, as we had no easy way to access the original back in those days, especially if you were a broke kid like me. Thus I decided to create this archive of Sailor Moon multimedia that I've been collecting ever since I was a young child coming home from school every day just to see what Sailor Moon goodies I could find on the internet.</p>
      <p>On top of this, these early days would lead me down my journey with my love for video editing that's been with me through all these years! So these old Sailor Moon multimedia files will always hold a special place in my heart.</p>
      <p>So yes, for most things on here you could probably find a much high quality version of it somewhere else, even on YouTube, but for those who want to re-live their Sailor Moon childhoods, the content on here is sure to spark some nostaglia for many!</p>
      <p>Enjoy!</p>
